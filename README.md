Oracle SQL Coding Samples

Initial Note 1/9/19: There are several sets of files in this particular repository. As a part of our coursework, we were tasked with creating and implementing a relational database of our choosing using Oracle SQL. Individual project requirements (creating views, insertions, etc.) are included inside the SQL file as comments. The Word documents contain the business purposes and general outline of the database, and the ERD file shows the visualized relationships between the different tables. 

I may include individual practice assignments as well in future updates.
